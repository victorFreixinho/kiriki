# Kiriki - Server

This is an IntelliJ java project.

> We chose not to define the project's JDK, so users can define it themselves.

## Defining the JDK Project

- Open the **server** directory in IntelliJ.
- Go to `server/src/Main.java`, click setup SDK and choose your SDK version.

## Running the project

To do this, just click on the green arrow next to the main class name.

![run project image](./readme_imgs/run.png)

If the JDK is configured correctly, the project will be built and the `out` directory will be created with the `.class` files.

After that, the server will run on the IntelliJ terminal.
