# Kiriki - Server

## Defining the SDK Project

- Go to `server/src/Main.java`, click setup SDK and choose your SDK version.

- Alternatively, you can setup SDK by going to `File > Project Structure > Project SDK` and choosing an option.

## Running the project

To do this, just click on the green arrow next to the main class name.

![run project image](../readme_imgs/server/run.png)

If the JDK is configured correctly, the project will be built and the `out` directory will be created with the `.class` files.

After that, the server will run on the IntelliJ terminal.
